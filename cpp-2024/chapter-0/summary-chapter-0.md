# Chapter 0: Getting Started

## Intro to Programming Languages

### What is a computer program?

Program is a set of instructions executed by a computer (CPU) to perform a task.
### Machine Language

 - A computer's CPU incapable of speaking C++, or generally programming languages. But, it can understand **machine code** (or **machine language**) directly, the 0's and 1's or often called binary digit (bit)
 - When computers first invented, programmers had to write programs directly in machine code.
 - Each command or instruction is composed by sequence of bits. The number of bits for a command may vary, depend on the CPU arch. For example, some CPUs always have 32 bits long for each instructions, whereas x86/x64 (modern CPU) have instructions that can be variable length.
 - Each bit is interpreted by the CPU into a command to do a very specific job, such as _compare these two numbers_, orÂ _put this number in that memory location_. 
 - Different CPUs have different instructions set. If we try to run a program on a CPU that didn't share the same instructions set, the program will be failed to run.
