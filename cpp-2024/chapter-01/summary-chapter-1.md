# Chapter 1: Summary

This chapter covers topics that are essential to C++ program, so it will not be that deep, but enough to get by. The goal of this chapter is to help you understand how basic C++ programs are constructed.

## Statements

- A computer program is basically a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do. Well, a statement is a ***type of instruction*** that causes the program to do perform action.
- Statements act much like sentences do in natural language. For example,  When we want to convey an idea to another person, we typically write or speak in sentences. In C++, when we want to have our program do something, we typically write statements.
- In a high-level language like C++, a statement may compile into many machine language instructions.

## Functions and the main function

- Actually, you know what it is right? It is a collection of statements that executes sequentially.
- Every C++ must have a `main` function. The return value of this function will be sent to the OS to indicate whether the program ran successfully or not.

## C++ STL

A library file is a collection of precompiled code that has been “packaged up” for reuse in other programs. The C++ Standard Library is a library that ships with C++. It contains additional functionality to use in your programs.
