# Chapter 1: Summary

This chapter covers topics that are essential to C++ program, so it will not be that deep, but enough to get by. The goal of this chapter is to help you understand how basic C++ programs are constructed.

## Statements

- A computer program is basically a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do. Well, a statement is a ==type of instruction== that causes the program to do perform action.
- Statements act much like sentences do in natural language. For example, Â When we want to convey an idea to another person, we typically write or speak in sentences. In C++, when we want to have our program do something, we typically write statements.
- In a high-level language like C++, a statement may compile into many machine language instructions.
